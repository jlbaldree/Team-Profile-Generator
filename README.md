## Installation
    
*Here are the steps to install the necessary components to run the program*
    
To install this application, A `.gitignore` file containing `node_modules/` and `.DS_Store/` directory is needed to prevent issues with GitHub. The file should be created before npm dependencies are installed. The repo will need to include a `package.json` by running `npm init` in the initial project setup. The folder structure will need to include a src directory with the HTMLtemplate js file in order for the formatting of the website to generate properly.
    
## Usage 
    
*Instructions on how to run and use the program*
    
First run node index.js in the terminal. Select the type of employee to be entered and follow the prompts to enter the applicable information. Any profile photos will need to be saved in the images folder under assets. If additional employees should be entered, select 'Y' when asked and continue following the prompts until no further employees need to be entered. Select 'N' and the application will generate the html document automatically and place it in the dist file in your directory.
